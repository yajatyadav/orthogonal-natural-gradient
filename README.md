# Continual Learning with ONG and ONG+

## Datasets

 The datasets we use (Rotated-MNIST and Permuted-MINST) are generated by using torchvision.datasets.MNIST and applying the necesarry transforms, this can all be found in the dataloaders folder.
 
## Requirements
- I ran most of the experiments with PyTorch = 1.5.1 
- The precise environment configuration is presented in *requirements.txt*


## Reproducibility

### Running the experiments
In order to replicate the results of the paper, please refer to the scripts provided in the scripts
 directory.
- To reproduce our results on Permuted-MNIST, run orthogonal-natural-gradient/scripts/commands/prod_permuted_mnist.sh
- To reproduce our results on Rotated-MNIST< run orthogonal-natural-gradient/scripts/commands/prod_rotated_mnist.sh

## Questions/ Bugs
- For questions or bugs, please feel free to raise an issue on Github.
